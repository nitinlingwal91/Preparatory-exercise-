# Problem Statement

Books drive all of us at ColoredCow. They give us a way to read and learn from what other people experienced in doing what we do. Be it understanding what to eat, how to sleep and all the way to whom to hire, whom to train, books have all of us covered.
For all the love of books, we can never have enough of them. Drop by our office some time and you will notice them all around. We buy books by the dozens and love to talk about them too.

 With the ever-increasing book inventory, we now need your help in building a platform for us to view the books in our library and add the new ones.
